The Obese Class 1, 2, and 3 categories are part of the Body Mass Index (BMI) classification system used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess body weight relative to height.

ðŸ§® BMI Categories Explained
Category	BMI Range (kg/mÂ²)	Interpretation
Underweight	< 18.5	Too little body fat
Normal weight	18.5 â€“ 24.9	Healthy range
Overweight	25.0 â€“ 29.9	Slight excess fat
Obese Class 1	30.0 â€“ 34.9	Moderate obesity
Obese Class 2	35.0 â€“ 39.9	Severe obesity
Obese Class 3	â‰¥ 40.0	Very severe / morbid obesity

BMI is calculated as:
        BMI= WeightÂ (kg)/HeightÂ (m)^2


While it's a useful general indicator, BMI doesn't account for muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution.
